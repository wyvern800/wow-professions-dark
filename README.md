## WoW Professions Dark Mode
Ok, if you're like me that suffer to read stuff that aren't in dark mode, here's your salvation, I created a fast java script that will change the patterns for the sake of your reading.

Chrome Extension created for World of Warcraft fansite '**wow-professions.com**' that will change the default whitened colour pattern to a darkish one (easier to read for some people like me :D)

I hope you enjoy, u'l have to set ur chrome to developer mode to have this extension working cause I didn't pay the registration fee.
